-- Seed data for restaurant reviews application
-- This script will be executed after init-db.sql
-- Note: This will only work after Prisma migrations have been run

-- The actual seeding will be handled by a separate TypeScript seed script
-- because we need to:
-- 1. Hash passwords using bcrypt
-- 2. Generate proper CUIDs for relations
-- 3. Ensure referential integrity

-- This file is kept as a placeholder for now
-- Run `npm run db:seed` after migrations to populate data
